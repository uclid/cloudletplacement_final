# A Bifactor Approximation Algorithm for Cloudlet Placement in Edge Computing

A bifactor approximation algorithm (ACP) to solve the heterogeneous cloudlet placement problem to guarantee a bounded latency and placement cost, while fully mapping  user applications  to  appropriate cloudlets.

We aim to efficiently place  cloudlets  to specific locations in a region to serve the demands of all the end devices (IoT) that require  edge services. We model the region as a two-dimensional space (grid), where cloudlets and devices can exist. The devices could be at any point in the space. On the other hand, we assume only a set of candidate points within the grid are available where the cloudlets can be placed and the devices can be best served from. The candidate points are selected based on the load of user requests and the  location of user demands over a long period.

## Data Creation
* Complete Dataset used in the experiments is available in [datasets](datasets) directory
* Datasets can be reproduced by running classes in [OpenDataToDataset](utils/dataset_creation/OpenDataToDataset.java)
  * Pass the integer argument (1-5) to `getDevices()` and `getCandidates()` methods to indicate different boroughs of NYC and generate respective base_device.csv and base_points.csv files. 
  * The samples can be generated by running [DatasetSampling](utils/dataset_creation/DatasetSampling.java) (Note: change the `root` and `total_num` variables to set the root path and number of rows in the base files. Also, change the `outpath` and filename depending on the dataset samples you want to create i.e., devices.csv or points.csv.)
  * For each sample, you can generate cloudlet.csv and cost.csv by running [CalcCandidateCosts](utils/dataset_creation/CalcCandidateCosts.java) by passing the path of directory containing sub-sample to `setCloudletsAndCandidateCosts()` method.
  * Likewise, latencies.csv can be produced by setting the source directory in `main()` method of [CalcLatency](utils/dataset_creation/CalcLatency.java).
* Please note that the datasets prodcued using random sampling might lead to slightly different results. Use of provided dataset will reproduce exact results.

## Running the Code
* Setup and Dependencies
  * You can import the code as a standard Java Project into any IDE, or from command-line in a local diretory.
  * The main depency required is `cplex.jar` available in [external_lib](external_lib) directory. Add this as an external library to your project. (The process differs depending on the IDE or command-line setup).
* [MainRunner](main_classes/runners/MainRunner.java)
  * The `main` method runs different approaches based on the first input argument (1-4) to `run()` method in the order below
    1. OCP Cost
    2. OCP Latency
    3. ACP
    4. GACP
  * Example:- Line 174: `results_summary.add(run(4, cloudlets, points, devices, cost, latency, lp_solve));` will run GACP based on the dataset path set in Line 141 for the sample numbers in the range specified in Line 139 (typically 1 to 30).
  * `lp_solve` is not required for OCP Cost and OCP Latency and can be commented out to avoid additional runtime overhead.
 * Special runtime considerations
   * OCP Latency and ACP can be run for all samples without any special changes to the code.
   * OCP Cost and GACP need modifications  to run across different samples due to the machine limitations and converge behavior of the algorithms.
     * OCP Cost approach requires node limited solutions for larger instances since CPLEX cannot converge to optimal solutions for a very long time. For that, `model.setParam(IloCplex.Param.MIP.Limits.Nodes, 15);` must be added after Line 15 in [CplexCloudletPlacement](cplex_model/algorithm/CplexCloudletPlacement.java). Note that the second argument (15) needs to be adjusted for specific datasets for convergence to appropriate accuracy and within reasonable time. [More details in next section]
     * GACP requires coverage values less than 1.0 for larger instances since it may not converge for a long time when full coverage is expected. This value needs to be adjusted for specific datasets. [More details in next section]
