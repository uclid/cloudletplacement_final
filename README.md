# A Bifactor Approximation Algorithm for Cloudlet Placement in Edge Computing

A bifactor approximation algorithm (ACP) to solve the heterogeneous cloudlet placement problem to guarantee a bounded latency and placement cost, while fully mapping  user applications  to  appropriate cloudlets.

We aim to efficiently place  cloudlets  to specific locations in a region to serve the demands of all the end devices (IoT) that require  edge services. We model the region as a two-dimensional space (grid), where cloudlets and devices can exist. The devices could be at any point in the space. On the other hand, we assume only a set of candidate points within the grid are available where the cloudlets can be placed and the devices can be best served from. The candidate points are selected based on the load of user requests and the  location of user demands over a long period.

## Data Creation
* Complete Dataset used in the experiments is available in [datasets](datasets) directory
* Datasets can be reproduced by running [OpenDataToDataset](utils/dataset_creation/OpenDataToDataset.java)
  * Pass the integer parameter (1-5) to `getDevices()` and `getCandidates()` methods to indidcate different boroughs of NYC and generate base devies and candidate points files respectively. 
  * The samples can be generated by running [DatasetSampling](utils/dataset_creation/DatasetSampling.java) (Note: change the "root" and "total_num" variables to set the root path and number of rows in the base files. Also, change the "outpath" and filename depending on the dataset samples you want to create i.e., devices.csv or points.csv.)
  * For each sample, you can generate cloudlet.csv and cost.csv by running [CalcCandidateCosts](utils/dataset_creation/CalcCandidateCosts.java) by passing the path of directory containing sub-sample to `setCloudletsAndCandidateCosts()` method.
  * Likewise, latencies.csv can be produced by setting the source directory in `main()` method of [CalcLatency](utils/dataset_creation/CalcLatency.java).
* Please note that the datasets prodcued using random sampling might lead to slightly different results. Use of provided dataset will reproduce exact results.
